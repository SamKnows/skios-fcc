This is the GitHub repository that contains the source-code for the SamKnows FCC Speed test app for iOS. This repository contains the custom code used in the FCC's version of the app. This code mainly relates to FCC specific UI elements and custom app configuration.

The FCC iOS app build is also dependent on the code provided in the skios-core GitHub repository for its core functionality.

SamKnows has made this code public in line with its commitment of open data and a transparent technical methodology and in line with the FCC's requirements for making the app code publicly available.

The FCC's speed test app is used to measure mobile broadband performance across the United States of America. More information on this FCC sponsored project can be found at www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america/mobile
